# Multi-Modal Credit Rating System

## Overview
This project is an innovative credit rating system that leverages multi-modal features such as gait analysis, facial emotions, and voice emotions to achieve dynamic, emotion-driven credit evaluation. By integrating deep learning technologies like I3D and Transformer, the system enhances traditional credit rating methods and addresses key challenges in risk management and fairness.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Modal Feature Fusion**: Combines gait, facial emotion, and voice emotion features for comprehensive credit evaluation.
- **High-Risk Behavior Prediction**: Detects risky behaviors through gait and posture analysis, enabling pre-emptive alerts.
- **Real-Time Credit Scoring**: Dynamically updates credit scores based on historical and real-time emotional data.
- **Enhanced FICO Scoring**: Optimizes historical credit analysis by integrating multi-dimensional data.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Built on the PaddlePaddle Pipeline Serving platform for efficient, scalable deployment.

## Benefits
- **Fair Credit Support**: Provides equitable credit evaluation for SMEs and younger demographics.
- **Improved Risk Management**: Reduces default rates by over 30% through precise, dynamic risk assessment.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Supports millions of concurrent requests with high reliability.
- **Social Impact**: Facilitates inclusive financial support, addressing challenges faced by underrepresented groups.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PaddlePaddle for model training and deployment.
- **Models**:
  - **I3D**: Spatio-temporal feature extraction for gait analysis.
  - **Transformer**: Global temporal feature integration for voice emotion analysis.
- **Databases**:
  - CASIA Speech Emotion Database
  - RAF-DB and AffectNet for facial emotion recognition.
- **Deployment**: Microservice architecture using PaddlePaddle’s Pipeline Serving.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone github.com/Yynicky001/Credit
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure PaddlePaddle is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install paddlepaddle
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Data**:
   - Download and preprocess datasets (e.g., CASIA, RAF-DB, AffectNet).
   - Place them in the `data/` directory.

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Upload gait, facial, and voice data of a loan applicant.
- The system analyzes the data and generates a credit score based on historical and real-time evaluations.
- Access results via a web interface or API.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand dataset diversity to improve generalization.
- Introduce additional behavioral biometrics for richer credit evaluations.
- Integrate advanced risk prediction models for broader financial applications.
